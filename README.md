# Microfrontend Learning Project

Welcome to my microfrontend learning journey! This repository contains the practical implementation of concepts from a comprehensive microfrontend course.

## 🎯 Course Overview

This project is based on learning how to build microfrontends - a revolutionary architecture pattern that allows you to divide large applications into smaller, manageable sub-applications.

### Why Microfrontends?

Microfrontends provide several key benefits:

- ✅ **Smaller Codebases**: Author smaller, easier to understand codebases
- 🛠️ **Technology Freedom**: Use different libraries for each sub-app - bring the best tool for the job!
- 🚀 **Independent Deployments**: Deploy each portion separately - limit the chance of interrupting users
- 👥 **Team Independence**: Allow engineering teams to work independently

## 🏗️ What I'm Building

This course features practical examples with custom implementations to understand how microfrontends work. Through incremental learning, I'm mastering:

### Core Concepts

- Design patterns used by the largest companies in the world
- When and how to use microfrontends effectively
- Linking multiple apps together using tiered routing systems

### Technical Implementation

- CSS scoping to prevent cross-app contamination
- State isolation between applications
- Independent deployment strategies
- CI/CD pipeline automation
- Multi-framework integration
- Performance optimization with module federation
